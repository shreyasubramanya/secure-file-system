# This code uses LDAP for safe file upload and deletion based on user access.
# LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
# The code ensures that only authorized users can upload and delete files, based on their access level.
# The LDAP server is used to authenticate and authorize users, and to store information about their access levels.
# This code provides a secure way to manage files in a distributed environment.
